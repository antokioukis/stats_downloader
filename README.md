# stats_downloader for the greatest RPG game

As we all know DMs have to prep every session by picking their monsters and then go to their books either physical or PDF to have their
stats bookmarked as well as an image of the monster in question to show their players. At least this is what i do.

To make things a lot easier on my end i created this tiny application that captures the monsters' stats, image and if applicable spells,
inserts them into text and jpeg files and if needed does a little formatting.

This app helped me lower the prep time needed for each session while allowing me to focus on the things that matter in session planning.

The application's code is free to use and expand. If you are not familiar on how to use the code,
it is packaged on 2 versions on for Windows and one for Ubuntu-based systems.
